The point of this project is to build an in-memory Python dictionary of the English language for easy access in NLP applications. 

To my knowledge, this does not exist. Current dictionary packages rely on API calls under the hood, which are obviously extremely slow compared to key lookup.

Contributors are extremely welcome :)
